# Privacy Policy for ZeroDM – Delete LinkedIn Messages

*Last updated: October 2025*

Thank you for using **ZeroDM – Delete LinkedIn Messages**, a browser extension designed to help users clean and manage LinkedIn Direct Message conversations efficiently.

Your privacy is extremely important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how ZeroDM handles data and ensures that your information remains private and secure at all times.

---

## 1. Introduction

ZeroDM (“the Extension”) is developed and maintained by **Amit Das**.
This Privacy Policy describes how ZeroDM operates and handles data while you use the extension available on the Chrome Web Store.

By installing or using ZeroDM, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

---

## 2. Data Collection

ZeroDM **does not collect, transmit, sell, or share any personally identifiable information (PII)**.

The extension runs entirely within your browser and **never sends LinkedIn messages, account details, login information, or browsing data to any external servers**.
All message cleanup actions are performed locally on your device.

---

## 3. Data Storage

ZeroDM uses the **Chrome `storage` API** to store a small amount of **non-sensitive data locally on your device**, such as:

* Extension settings and user interface preferences
* Temporary cleanup state or progress indicators during message deletion sessions

No LinkedIn messages, usernames, passwords, or personal content are stored.
All stored data remains **local to your browser only** and is **never transmitted externally**.

---

## 4. Permissions Explanation

ZeroDM requests only the minimum permissions required to fulfill its **single purpose**.

### a. `storage`

Used to save basic extension preferences and temporary cleanup state locally to ensure smooth operation and a better user experience.

### b. `tabs`

Used to detect and interact with the user’s currently open LinkedIn tab when a cleanup action is manually initiated.
ZeroDM does **not** monitor browsing activity, track history, or access unrelated tabs.

### c. `host_permissions`

```
*://*.linkedin.com/*
```

This permission allows ZeroDM to access and interact **only** with LinkedIn Direct Message pages in order to perform message cleanup actions.
The extension does **not** access or interact with any other websites or domains.

---

## 5. Third-Party Services

ZeroDM does **not** use:

* Analytics services
* Advertising networks
* External APIs
* Third-party servers

All functionality operates entirely within the browser.

---

## 6. Data Security

Because ZeroDM does not transmit or store personal data externally, the risk of data exposure is minimal.
Users are encouraged to keep their browser up to date and install the extension only from the official Chrome Web Store.

---

## 7. User Control

Users can remove all locally stored data at any time by:

1. Uninstalling the ZeroDM extension from Chrome, and/or
2. Clearing browser storage via **chrome://settings/clearBrowserData**

No residual data remains after uninstallation.

---

## 8. Changes to This Policy

Any future updates to this Privacy Policy will be published at the same official project or repository location.
Users are encouraged to review it periodically.
